# Memory Access Optimization in a GPU using CUDA

Project presented in the Advanced Computer Architectures (Universidade de Aveiro), 2017

The main goal is to change the grid and block dimensions in the GPU using CUDA programming (C) and discover the optimal solution for the problem.
Other goal is to change the program to allow better pararelization of operations and discover again the optimal solution.
